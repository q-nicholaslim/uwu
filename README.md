## What is this?

`uwu` is a lightweight, focused CLI tool that converts natural language into shell commands using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-5. Unlike comprehensive agentic development tools like [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com), `uwu` has a simple, singular purpose: **helping you write shell commands faster, without switching context**.

`uwu` is not a replacement for comprehensive agentic development tools -- it is simple tool that excels at one thing. Consider it the terminal equivalent of quickly searching "how do I..." and getting an immediately runnable answer.

After a response is generated, you can edit it before pressing enter to execute the command. This is useful if you want to add flags, or other modifications to the command.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/context-labs/uwu.git
cd uwu
```

### 2. Install dependencies and build

Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed.

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```

This will produce the `uwu-cli` binary in the `dist/` build output directory.

### 3. Make the binary executable and move it into your PATH

```bash
chmod +x dist/uwu-cli
mv dist/uwu-cli /usr/local/bin/uwu-cli
```

### 4. Configuration

`uwu` is configured through a single `config.json` file. The first time you run `uwu`, it will automatically create a default configuration file to get you started.

#### Configuration File Location

The `config.json` file is located in a standard, platform-specific directory:

- **Linux:** `~/.config/uwu/config.json`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Preferences/uwu/config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\uwu\\config.json` (e.g., `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\uwu\\config.json`)

#### Provider Types

You can configure `uwu` to use different AI providers by setting the `type` field in your `config.json`. The supported types are `"OpenAI"`, `"Custom"`, `"Claude"`, and `"Gemini"`.

Below are examples for each provider type.

---

##### **1. OpenAI (`type: "OpenAI"`)**

This is the default configuration.

```json
{
  "type": "OpenAI",
  "apiKey": "sk-your_openai_api_key",
  "model": "gpt-4.1"
}
```

- `apiKey`: Your OpenAI API key. If this is empty, `uwu` will use the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

---

##### **2. Claude (`type: "Claude"`)**

Uses the native Anthropic API.

```json
{
  "type": "Claude",
  "apiKey": "your-anthropic-api-key",
  "model": "claude-3-opus-20240229"
}
```

- `apiKey`: Your Anthropic API key.

---

##### **3. Gemini (`type: "Gemini"`)**

Uses the native Google Gemini API.

```json
{
  "type": "Gemini",
  "apiKey": "your-google-api-key",
  "model": "gemini-pro"
}
```

- `apiKey`: Your Google AI Studio API key.

---

##### **4. Custom / Local Models (`type: "Custom"`)**

This type is for any other OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, such as Ollama, LM Studio, or a third-party proxy service.

```json
{
  "type": "Custom",
  "model": "llama3",
  "baseURL": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
  "apiKey": "ollama"
}
```

- `model`: The name of the model you want to use (e.g., `"llama3"`).
- `baseURL`: The API endpoint for the service.
- `apiKey`: An API key, if required by the service. For local models like Ollama, this can often be a non-empty placeholder like `"ollama"`.

---

#### Context Configuration (Optional)

`uwu` can include recent command history from your shell to provide better context for command generation. This feature is disabled by default but can be enabled. When enabled, `uwu` includes the raw last N lines from your shell history (e.g., bash, zsh, fish), preserving any extra metadata your shell records:

```json
{
  "type": "OpenAI",
  "apiKey": "sk-your_api_key",
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "context": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxHistoryCommands": 10
  }
}
```

- `enabled`: Whether to include command history context (default: `false`)
- `maxHistoryCommands`: Number of recent commands to include (default: `10`)
  When enabled, `uwu` automatically detects and parses history from bash, zsh, and fish shells.

##### Notes on history scanning performance

- **Chunk size unit**: When scanning shell history files, `uwu` reads from the end of the file in fixed-size chunks of 64 KiB. This is not currently configurable but can be made if desired.

##### Windows notes

- **History detection**: On Windows, `uwu` searches for PowerShell PSReadLine history at:
  - `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt` (Windows PowerShell 5.x)
  - `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt` (PowerShell 7+)
    If not found, it falls back to Unix-like history files that may exist when using Git Bash/MSYS/Cygwin (e.g., `.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`).
- **Directory listing**: On Windows, directory listing uses `dir /b`; on Linux/macOS it uses `ls`.

### 5. Add the `uwu` helper function to your `~/.zshrc`

This function lets you type `uwu <description>` and get an editable command preloaded in your shell.

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc

uwu() {
  local cmd
  cmd="$(uwu-cli "$@")" || return
  vared -p "" -c cmd
  print -s -- "$cmd"   # add to history
  eval "$cmd"
}
```

After editing `~/.zshrc`, reload it:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage

Once installed and configured:

```bash
uwu generate a new ssh key called uwu-keyand add it to the ssh agent
```

You'll see the generated command in your shell's input line. Press **Enter** to run it, or edit it first. Executed commands will show up in your shell's history just like any other command.
